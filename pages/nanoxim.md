**Project description:** During my graduate research, I developed a MATLAB software package to quantify oxygnation of open wounds in real time. Phorphorescnet images are acquired of the wound site while irrigated with oxygen sensing nanoparticles. The ratio of the intensity of the red to blue channels provides a stable measure of oxygenation due to their chemistry.

**Abstract:** 
We have previously demonstrated the ability of a difluoroboron β-diketonate poly(lactic acid) material, BF2nbm(I)PLA, hereafter nbm, to detect tissue oxygen levels in murine cutaneous wound beds 1. This relies on oxygen-insensitive fluorescence (F) as an internal standard and oxygen-sensitive phosphorescence (P) as a sensor. In an effort to improve imaging agent clearance and ease of manufacture, as well as to optimize emission wavelengths to color channels of RGB cameras, a new dithienyl dye, BF2dtm(I)C12H25-, hereafter dtm, with red phosphorescence was developed. The dtm dye was mixed with a blue fluorescent dye, BF2dbm(F)OCH12H25, hereafter dbm, and coprecipitated with PLA to form oxygen sensing nanoparticles.

The objective of this study was to verify the utility of the newly developed dtm/dbm nanoparticles for sensing tissue oxygen levels in murine wound beds. To achieve this, we monitored the relative tissue oxygen levels of healing full-thickness cutaneous wounds in C57BL/6J mice over the course of one week with both dtm/dbm and nbm using an RGB camera mounted to a microscope and custom MATLAB software.

We found the new dtm/dbm nanoparticles yielded nearly identical trends over time in wound bed F/P versus nbm. The dtm/dbm nanoparticles did not impair wound closure and demonstrated less adhesion to healing tissues relative to nbm. Dtm/dbm retains the tissue oxygen-sensing capability of nbm while having fewer synthetic steps, better phosphorescence alignment with red RGB channel, improved solubility, and less retention in wound tissue than nbm.
