**Project description:** I served as the instructor for this undergraduate class for
1. 2022 Fall (45 students)
2. 2023 Spring (55 students)
The course was a mix of coding assignments and larger group projects and student essays. 
For the technical skills aspects of the material, students learned how to effectively code in R, along with key data cleaning and visualization packages such as Dplyer, Plotly, and Shiny. This knowledge was continuously tested with weekly coding assignments along with large group projects that included a report, presentations, and interactive web page.
The philosophical portion of the course, students learned the many ways that data can be misrepreentted, along with developing an appreciation of difficult and nuanced a process visualizing and communicationg the meaning of data can be. To this end, students were assigned to read "How Charts Lie" by Alberto Cairo, discuss them as a class and in smaller groups, and write essays about the topics presented.

For the final, student made their own interactive dashboard with Shiny and Plotly to answer an original research question. Screenshots of their visualizations are below.
